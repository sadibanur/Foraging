# Module04-Assessment-sustainable-foragingFor
Sustainable Foraging is an application that tracks foragers, forageable items, and successful forages. The features of the application:
-Add an Item.
-View Items.
-View Foragers.
-Add a Forage.
-View Forages by date.
The application uses a three-layer architecture with data, domain, and ui layers. In addition to application features, I add Spring dependency injection to the project.
